# Calculator

I will use what I learned from The Odin Project (Fundamentals) to make a calculator.

The calculator:
  - supports (+, -, *, /)
  - has a UI that supports these buttons (numbers 0-9, operators, decimal point, clear, backspace)
  - supports decimal user input 
  - supports keyboard input
